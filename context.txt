Iâ€™m building an on-chain PvP NFT battle game on the Sui blockchain, designed for IRL events (like conferences) but submitted to a virtual hackathon. Every attendee receives an NFT minted by the event organizer.

ðŸ”¥ Game Summary:
Organizer mints one NFT per pre-approved wallet address.

Each NFT has a type: A, B, or C, assigned randomly.

Players challenge each other using a two-step battle process for fairness:

Player A proposes a battle (calls propose_battle(B))

Player B accepts the battle (calls battle_with(A))

This ensures both players meet and consent, preventing battle-farming abuse.

ðŸ§¬ Battle Rules:
A beats B 75% of the time

B beats C 75% of the time

C beats A 75% of the time

Same type = 50/50

ðŸ§¬ Outcome:
Winner's NFT mutates to a new type based on a deterministic rule (A+B â†’ C, etc.)

Winnerâ€™s kill count increases by 1

Loserâ€™s NFT is burned

The goal is to survive and evolve through battles. A leaderboard (off-chain) ranks players by kill count. Trait visuals and complex metadata are not required for the hackathon version.

I want  full front-end that's clean and impressive UI that I can DEMO how this game would work. so more on impressive demo than scalable/etc. can mock or fake some components for ease of demo. it's a short demo.
